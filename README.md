## Credits

the usual suspects are here, [phobos](https://github.com/Hqrion/Phobos-1.9.0-BUILDABLE-SRC), [gamesense](https://github.com/IUDevman/gamesense-client), some [xulu](https://github.com/Elementars/Xulu-v1.5.2)

Also the old gui is using [panel studio](https://github.com/lukflug/PanelStudio/)

Travis, for Wurst Plus Three, [Wurst+3](https://github.com/TrvsF/wurst-plus-three/)

## Why

Wurst+3 Hasnt been updated in awhile, so I made a sequel. Instead of Wurst+4, I have renamed it after myself, XSS6, naming this XSWARE. It's a remake of my old XSWARE client.

## How

Download the latest release or build yourself, put file into your mods folder and run with forge 1.12.2

## Build

If you want to compile your own binaries use the following commands


```bash
./gradlew setupdecompworkspace
./gradlew build
```

## Usage

Right shift opens the GUI

'.' is the default prefix, to change this go to .minecraft\XSWARE\configs\default\BINDS.txt and change the top line
